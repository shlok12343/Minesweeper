# Minesweeper Game in Java

This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. It features a graphical user interface using the `javalib` library and allows players to challenge themselves by avoiding mines to clear the board.

## Features

- Graphical interface to interact with the game.
- Customizable grid size and number of mines.
- Randomized mine placement with the option to seed for repeatable configurations.
- Neighbor cell awareness for each cell in the grid, aiding gameplay logic.
- Game status updates and cell state changes (flagged, opened).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) [download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- An IDE that supports Java and external libraries (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minesweeper-game-java.git
   ```
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure the `javalib` library is correctly configured in your project settings.

### Running the Game

To run the game, navigate to the `Minesweeper` class and run it as a Java application. The game will start in a new window with the default settings.

## Usage

Upon starting the game, you will see a grid of cells. Each cell can be clicked to open, right-clicked to flag, or both, depending on your strategy:

- **Left Click** on a cell to open it.
- **Right Click** on a cell to toggle a flag indicating a suspected mine.

Win the game by opening all non-mine cells. The game ends if a mine is clicked.
